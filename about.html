        ><br />
        The scroll bar in the searchstatusprocess is a unique feature I built
        that allows you to browse through all of the status and see them all
        without having to leave the box. Another attempt I made was to construct
        a container that would follow the backdrop, but I was having
        difficulties developing the CSS so that it would be in a fixed place
        rather than following the background.
        <p>
          <b>Which part(s) did you have trouble with?</b><br />
          The sql query was the portion that gave me difficulties because the
          example codes for sql queries didn't work in the php file. Another
          task was to check the status code and status because the traditional
          way of data retrieval failed. Another issue that arose was the error
          codes, which despite echoing the errors, still displayed the data
          entered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What would you like to do better next time?</b><br />
          I'd like to modify the layout by switching to bootstrap instead of
          CSS, which would improve the overall look of the page. Another option
          is to learn shorter methods of checking errors, such as error messages
          or custom invaid texts in the form, in order to decrease code and
          similar repetition, or to use functions to shorten the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What you have learnt along the way?</b><br />
          I've learnt about uncommon tags like fieldset and legends, as well
          basic input attributes like mandatory, pattern, and autofocus. I also
          learned how to link the database and use the public folder. In
          addition, to also learning CSS foundations.

          ><br />
          I used sites like stackoverflow for tricky solutions as some of my
          sources. The lab examples, such as database connection, as well as
          sites like w3schools.com, geeksforgeeks, javatpoint, and
          developer.mozilla, where they have many examples to explain and
          showcase how the code works.
